# Flutter Mobile App DEMO

This is a demo of Flutter Mobile App for study purposes. 

I created this app that shows exercises from a gym workout which you can add your reps and weights, see your logged workouts on a calendar and using timer for rest between sets.
The main focus it has been in the development and not in the UI.

## Tech used

- Flutter / Dart
- MongoDB
- NodeJS for the server
